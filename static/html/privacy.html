<p>8. How Your Personal Data Is Transferred Globally</p>
<p>Since we currently only support the withdrawal of rupee in the Indian region, we only provide complete product services for India, and we may provide Go!

These jurisdictions include but are not limited to Singapore, United States, and China.</p>
<p>Please note that we only return demographic information to China and we do not include information on individual user identities. At the same time, in order to provide you with better services, our third party partners may transmit your data to other countries. For example, in order to detect robots or cheating, we have purchased a Chinese supplierâs traffic monitoring service. The merchant may return the user information to China in order to assist us in analyzing whether there is cheating in the user.</p>
<p>Personal data protection legislation in such jurisdiction might be different or even absent. Under such circumstance, we will adopt various measures to ensure security of your personal data. For instance, we will ask you for your explicit consent before transmission of your personal data, or implement security measures such as encryption and pseudonymisation during data transmission; when your personal data is transferred to such jurisdictions, we will apply the same protection of your personal data in accordance with the Policy. We will endeavor to protect your personal data with the measures stipulated in Article 46 and Article 47 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
