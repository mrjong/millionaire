<li><strong>About Go! Millionaire</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Go! Millionaire is a live trivia game based on html5 launched by APUS. There are 12 questions. Registered users who get them all right will split the cash prize.</p>
<p>Go! Millionaire mainly includes the following features:</p>
<p>1) Answer questions to win prize: Each game of Go! Millionaire is a series of twelve multiple choice questions. The types of questions cover science, culture, entertainment, arts, etc. Users only have ten seconds to answer each question. A single wrong answer or timeout gets you eliminated; Players who answer 12 questions correctly will split the prize with the rest of winners. The amount of bonuses may also increase correspondingly during the holidays or when players increase;</p>
<p>2) Reminder: In order to help players not miss the game, you can use the “set reminder” function to remind you play the game and you can get reminder notification 10 minutes in advance before the game.</p>
<p>3) Prize withdrawal: Users can only use the cash withdrawal function after signing in through phone number or a third party. The bonus more than Rs. 150 can be withdrawn. To ensure that your withdrawal request can be transferred successfully, you need to provide your name and Paytm account, PANID, etc. If the submitted information is correct, you will get the bonus within 7 working days after review approval.</p>
<p>If you fail to withdraw your bonus within the specified 90 days, you will be deemed to have lost your bonuses and we can determine the use of the bonuses.</p>
<p>4) Revival card function: In order to increase users’ chance of winning, the game has set up a “revival” mechanism. The use of a revival card in each game requires certain conditions. When the user answers the question incorrectly, if there is a revival card in his/her account and it meets the conditions of use, the system will automatically let you continue the game. The user invites the new user to play the game with his/her own invitation code. After the registration is successful, both the user and the new user can obtain a revival card.</p>
<p>5) Friends sharing: You can share the game with your friends or share it on social media through a third-party application. The current sharing function supports third-party applications such as Facebook, messenger, whatsapp, and twitter.</p>
